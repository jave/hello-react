minimal react thing mostly for testing tooling.

install npx(so you need npm 1st)
npm install -g npx

and you need a recent node, in this case using nvm
nvm install node

npx create-react-app hello-react
cd hello-react
npm start

okay, so then you get stuff on port 3000. very well.

so, now i want a production build

npm run build

test the static build

  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build

okay, this also worked. funnily the build dir for this hello world is
200Mb. oh tempora o mores

a .git is also created

clean
rm -rf node_modules  build

okay, fine and dandy.
now i want a dockerfile that builds the thing, and then runs it with
nginx. 

i want the "as builder" syntax, so i guess i need a newer docker than
1.13.

i had to do https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/
also, i needed the test channel to get pkgs for fc 30. fantastic.

run the thing on port 5000
sudo docker run -it  -p 5000:80 2bbb5389dbb1

okay, next thing is openshift.
